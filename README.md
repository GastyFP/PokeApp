This is a Single Page App i made in the [SoyHenry](https://www.soyhenry.com/) Bootcamp.

### Versions

the versions that i could use were:
- __Node__: 12.18.3 or gt
- __NPM__: 6.14.16 or gt

- __react__: 17.0.1
- __react-dom__: 17.0.1
- __react-router-dom__: 5.2.0
- __redux__: 4.0.5
- __react-redux__: 7.2.3

Content was created with Create React App

## General Idea

Create an application that you could see the different pokemon that exist using an external API [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) and also filter/ order them, create new ones and finally search for some pokemon

### The only endpoints i could use were

- GET <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon>
- GET <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}>
- GET <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}>
- GET <https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type>

Its important to know that i could NOT use any external library to apply styles in my app. only pure css . i was allowed to use SASS

#### Mandatory Tecnologies

- [ ] React
- [ ] Redux
- [ ] Express
- [ ] Sequelize - Postgres
